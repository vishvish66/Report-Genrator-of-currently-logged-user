# Report-Genrator-of-currently-logged-user
Imagine that you're an IT specialist working in a medium-sized company, your manager wants to create a daily report that tracks the use of machines.  Specifically, she wants to know which users are currently connected to which machines, it's your job to create the report.  In your company, there's a system that collects every event that happens on the machines on the network.  Among the many events collected it records each time a user logs in or out of a computer.  With this information, we want to write a script that generates a report of which users are logged in to which machines at that time.
